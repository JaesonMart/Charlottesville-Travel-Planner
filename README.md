### TO RUN:
- Local development will require first creating a Super User account using 'python manage.py createsuperuser'. After this, you can run, 'pyton manage.py migrate', then 'python manage.py makemigrations' and lastly 'python manage.py runserver'. Now navigate to 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin'. From here set up the social application with the necessary credentials to allow for the Google Maps API to work correctly. The application can now be used locally using a sqlite database as the means of data persistence.
